In this project, we study whether CEO tweeting behavior is associated with how much their company’s stock moves the next day.
We combine daily CEO tweets from Twitter with daily stock returns and estimate a multivariable regression of next-day absolute return on:
1. how many tweets the CEO posts,
2. how positive or negative those tweets are,
3. how much engagement those tweets receive,
4. and standard market controls (today’s volatility and trading volume),
5. plus firm fixed effects.


Overall, we find that market conditions and investor attention explain more of next-day volatility than tweet tone alone, and that any tweet-related effects should be interpreted as associations, not causal impacts.
